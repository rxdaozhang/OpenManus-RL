Welcome to the game of Wordle!
Your objective is to guess a hidden 5 letter word.
You have 6 attempts to guess it correctly and you should try to guess it in as few attempts as possible.
After guessing the word, you will receive feedback from the game environment in the form of a color-coded version of your word. The color given for each letter means the following:

black/white (default text color): If the environment returns a black or white letter (depending on your system setup), it means that the letter at that position in your guessed word is not in the hidden word.
yellow: If the environment returns a yellow letter, it means that the letter at that position in your guessed word is in the hidden word but is not in the correct position.
green: If the environment returns a green letter, it means that the letter at that position in your guessed word is in the hidden word and is in the correct position.

As a note, if you guess an invalid word (e.g. not a 5 letter word or a word not in the vocabulary), the environment will respond with an "invalid word" message.
For your reference, here is the complete list of valid vocabulary words that are accepted by the game:
